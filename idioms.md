# Idiomatic Grammuelle

Grammuelle enables not only a declarative, functional style, but naming in CSS 
becomes an entirely different practice:

1. `modules`
2. `grids`
3. `displays`
4. `hooks` (`before`, `after` order serializations)
5. `models`
6. `basics`

Names sort of fill in a void space on lines. Grammuelle reads like so:

--------
  Conditional Gram
--------
    Conitional Gram
--------
      Conditional Gram
      ...

Generally there's a tendency for code to "creep" on the line. Grammuelle is a kind of 
formalism for normalizing the line of lines as it encourages `Template` sharing between
`Declaratives` within the space of named objects like `modules` or `hooks` of a designed
cybernetic (interfaces) system or a physical (real basics) system.

Concepts like modality, sequence, temporality are expressed through the combination of
our syntax and meaning, but the hypothetical, conjectural, etc. tone of CSS may only
be identified from first a declarative mode of construction.
